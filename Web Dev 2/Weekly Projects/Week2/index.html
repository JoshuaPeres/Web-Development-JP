    <h2>Hi! Nice to meet you.</h2><br>
    <p>
        You can call me Josh. I'm 19 years old, and I'm a student in the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin College. <br>

        <br> Yep, that's me. I'm not as flattering as I wish I was.
        <br> Currently, I'm taking the Web Dev 2 course (MTM6201). On the side, I work as a graphics producer for a YouTube channel with over <strong>1 million</strong> subscribers!
        <br> That's all I've got for you now. Take care!
