            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <strong>Hi, I'm <strong>Joshua Peres</strong>. I'm a 19 year old autistic male. I am currently in my 1<sup>st</sup> term of my IMD program. Since the age of 17, I have been working towards getting a job in either <em>mathematics or media arts</em> . I have dabbled in graphic design since my teenage years.</strong>
            <br>
            <strong>Being autistic, my social life has been <em>significantly different</em> from the average human's. Since the 3<sup>rd</sup> grade, I've struggled with making friends. I've never been someone who enjoys conversations. I have tried to work on it in recent years, however. Due to my beliefs in several fields being so polarizing, I also struggle with keeping friends.</strong>
