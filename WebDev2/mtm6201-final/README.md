# *Oh hey, you found my info page!*

Hi, I'm **Joshua Peres****. I'm a media artist based in Ottawa, Ontario. I currently run JP Studios, a freelance graphic design company.

That being said, website development isn't really my thing. Working on this website was largely aided by consulting the internet, and asking close friends for help. I spent about 4 nights trying to make things work, which would either result in a working page or me falling asleep in front of the keyboard.

Everything on this website was made with the help of `Bootstrap` and `Animate.css`. I'm not exactly the best person to hire for programming. But I assume you know that just from reading and snooping around these pages...
